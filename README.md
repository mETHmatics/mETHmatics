- 👋 Hi, I’m @mETHmatics ... but it's really only Mother who calls me that. To my friends, I am Thibault [...to my enemies I am fear itself!]
- 👀 I’m interested in ... structures, machines, systems, and change - naturally, I'm an engineer [...I tend not to like company very much, and I look askance at
- society generally. I am in all aspects of life other than the professional utterly freaked out by change. Hate it. Can't abide it!!]
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... lots! Before yesterday I had never coded anything. Nothing. I'm a fast learner [...and fast learning I'm no longer the biggest
- nerd in the room with programmers around, but I also feel less lonely in the world. Thank you, Nerdy Strangers of the internet!]
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Well, whatever I may be trusted with at this point. I must say, I have an eye for detail, symmetry, balance, harmony,
- that comes out as creative/artistic flair. I'm a really good designer [...fabricated all that bullshit in seconds, for example...] so maby something to do
- with AI would be good.
  
- 📫 How to reach me ... My fabulous e-mail: prome.notme@proton.me / me.thibault@proton.me [ ...they both go straight down the same shit tube of an account
- I fucked years ago. I only picked them because the cool names]
- 😄 Pronouns: ... don't care, pronouns are used in the third-person: that is, used when you're talking about someone, not to them. If you are ever using my
- pronouns it's likely because I'm not there,, so why would I be bothered? I'm busy, call me by YOUR name - I don't care. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I have hidden clues in this markdown text. If you can figure it out, it will lead you closer and closer to me.
- You might be surprised who I am.
